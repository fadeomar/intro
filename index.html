      			<p>
              The first thing I choose on my life completely by myself is studying Civil Engineering, I didn't regret that, because it built a character that I like of me.
              And, after now finishing as the third best man of my year, I got the opportunity to do what I wanted to do a year ago, filling this academy application, as I couldn't do it after fullfilling all the conditions last year, because of the heavy load on me at university.
              AND NOW I DID IT!
